# Minecraft-Mods

This is a collection of Minecraft Mods (or "Modpack") that I have decided is very useful. You may not agree with my opinion and thats fine, but personally, I really like these mods. In the "Release" is a ".exe" file accompanied with a text file with its VirusTotal link. This is an installer which installs all the mods directly into the inputted folder.
